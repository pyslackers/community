The community has some projects going on!

These community driven projects are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/pyslackers). These projects are headed up by members of our community and are intended to provide value to our slack team and help members grow in their technical abilities. Each project has people who are leads and other members that act at a mentorship level. It's kinda like Xavier's school of gifted children except without a Blackbird SR-71.

## Projects

### SIR BOT A LOT & PLUGINS

[pyslackers/sir-bot-a-lot](https://github.com/pyslackers/sir-bot-a-lot)

A pluggable bot framework written using asyncio (a new feature in Python 3). There isn't another bot out there like this one.

You can see what he can do with `@sir-bot-a-lot help`, a few tips:

* `/admin <message>`: Send a message to the admin team, alerting us of any issues, or giving kudos, whatever you prefer.
* `/gif <query>`: Search Giphy
* `/pypi <query>`: Search PyPi for a package

### SLACK COMMUNITY WEBSITE

## Get started

All contributions are welcomed from any skill level. Low hanging fruit with getting started includes testing, documentation, code, feature ideas, bug reports, and front end design. You do not need to be a grandmaster Python jedi in order to contribute to one of the projects. If you are we welcome that too :wink:.

To get started you can choose a project your are interested in and look through the issues and pull requests. Issues and pull requests labeled `help wanted` are free to fix and/or review.
When fixing an issue please drop a comment so nobody will work on it at the same time.

We recommended you start with an issue labeled `difficulty/newcomers`.
