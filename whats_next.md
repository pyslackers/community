If you are here it means you have completed the first step in learning Python (if you are a beginner you can find some helpful links at the end of the document), namely learning the syntax and basic concepts of programming in Python. If you haven't, check the bottom for good places to get started.

A common question here is "what next?". The good news is that there are a lot of resources out there to help advance your knowledge. Here is a list of possible routes you could take. You don't have to do all, but any one of them could help you improve your Python:

## Start a project :dart:
Nothing helps to compound knowledge of a language more than using it. Let's get started right away?

Look at what you do at home or at work that is repetitive and see if you can try to automate it with Python. This could be almost anything you can think of, even if it is something small. [Here is a non Python-specific example of someone hacking their :coffee: coffee machine :coffee: to save a couple minutes a day]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCcO-6lb9zM). You can easily do the same with a Raspberry Pi and Python.

Can't think of anything to automate? How about building something new to destress your day like a bus/train departure tracker, or even something you could just be proud of and show off like a website.

The key is to set a target and work towards it, learning what is needed on the way. And obviously feel free to ask the team for help.

## Take a challenge :trophy:
You may have learnt the syntax, and on a project you may learn about many libraries and packages. But that doesn't make you the most efficient coder.

Most people never design a perfect algorithm on their first attempt, but you can get better at it. Challenge sites are designed to make you think about how you've designed your code and to try to improve upon it. The person with the most accurate and efficient code wins.

Good sites to try include:  

* https://www.codewars.com/  
* https://www.hackerrank.com/  
* https://projecteuler.net/  

Some of these may also incidentally help you to find a job.

Make sure to iterate over your code and don't be afraid to ask if you are stuck. We will try to not tell you the answer outright, but we can point out flaws in your design.

## Join the community :family:
It might look scary at first, but where a project will help you grasp new packages and ideas, and where challenges will help you learnt o perfect your problem solving, the community is what will teach you the best practices and standards for your code.

The easiest way is always to ask questions and request code reviews in [#help](https://pythondev.slack.com/messages/C07EFMZ1N). We will try to help as much as we can and offer advice on what you are doing and how to improve. If you can you should also feel free to contribute and answer questions yourself to help ground and confirm your own knowledge as well.

## Open Source Projects
This is part of joining the community, but also bridges the gap between the community and starting your own project (and to some extent, taking a challenge).

Joining an open source project can be one of the fastest ways to learn the best practices while simultaneously learning on a new project. Any mistakes you make that need to be corrected will be done when your code is reviewed and as a side effect you will learn about Version Control Systems, Pull Requests, Code Reviews, Unit testing and many other standard practices in the software world.

Even more importantly, you will make a significant and lasting impact on the programming community which will help the community to develop as a whole. It will also look awesome on your CV/résumé.

If you want to find a project to join, take a look at [#community_projects](https://pythondev.slack.com/messages/C2FMLUBEU) where we run some of our own projects. You can even start your own and get some of us to join if we're interested.

Other places to look include github.com and bitbucket.org where most open source projects are written. In the end most packages used today are open source, so if you aren't sure, take the package you use the most and see if they have any open issues that need fixing. Even Python itself is open source (although it is written in C, not Python).

## Learn a different language (Advanced) :anguished:
Python is an amazing language which can take you very far in your learning. But it is only one language. As an intermediate learner it is important to really get a feel for how to program and solve problems with a language. But at a more advanced level it may soon become apparent that Python isn't suited for every situation.

Once you reach a certain level often the best thing to do is learn an entirely new language. This won't be like starting all over, most of the paradigms and syntax you will recognize and understand very quickly. But often the focus or specific use of the language will be entirely different.

This isn't a bad thing and it doesn't mean Python is bad (come on, Python is awesome :mega:). But it will make you think differently as a programmer and be able to see a problem from more than one angle.

Depending on what you want to do, you may want to consider the following:

### Web development
Be warned for web development: The JavaScript community changes very rapidly for front-end frameworks, but the backend is becoming more stable in terms of changes. As a result many frameworks learned one year will be mostly redundant the next (seriously). That said it is still important to learn them.

This is one of the most common routes to go down in Python. You'll probably want to look into frameworks like Django and Flask for the backend side. But aside from that you'll need the following essential languages:  

* HTML  
* CSS  
* JavaScript  

The above are the absolute essentials for web development. If you want to do more modern web development you'll also want to learn the following:  
SASS/LESS/SCSS (pre-compilers for CSS. This means they are very similar to CSS, but are more powerful, yet still compile to CSS).  
ES6/7 - The newer specification of JavaScript. Also known as EMCA Script.  
NodeJS - JavaScript for the server.  
A Front End Framework - Angular, React/Redux, Ember, Vue, etc.

If you want to learn more niche (but still very much loved) web based languages, try one of the following:  

* Elm  
* TypeScript  
* CoffeeScript  

### App Development
Apps are extremely common nowadays and are definitely an area worth learning about. Luckily due to the monopoly Android and Apple share, there aren't many languages to learn.

The choice is generally between these two languages:  

* Swift/Objective-C (iOS)  
* Kotlin/Java (Android)  

These will help you learn a different way of programming in a system you are likely unfamiliar with as a developer. The only downside is writing a single app for both systems is itself a challenge.

If you do want to try and write a cross-platform app look into one of the following:  

* JavaScript with Phonegap  
* C/C++  
* Golang  
* Python with Kivy  
* React Native  


If you choose to work with either Golang or C/C++, particularly C, bare in mind these are lower level languages than Python and may take significantly longer to understand. However the benefits for doing are great.

### Systems/Desktop development
Most languages are suited for the desktop environment, including Python. However, many high level languages are locked to only a limited amount of power. Oftentimes, in this case, it is worth learning a lower level language.

Lower-level languages often hold multiple benefits including being compatible across most platforms, being able to access the machine without limits (this often makes them dangerous as well), being extremely fast and, particularly in the case of C, being able to write extensions to other languages such as Python.

If you want to follow this route of development look into:

* Golang  
* C/C++  
* Rust  

## I'm new to this and the above seems too advanced (beginners)
If you think you fit this section you have probably only just started learning Python. In which case it would be worth looking into some basic tutorials and books. The key we recommend is to learn Python 3.x and to start with the latest version. Many people still say Python 2 is still worth starting on, but the reality is that Python 2 is out dated and no longer used in new projects. Do not worry though, even if you start on Python 3, Python 2 is very similar and very easy to learn afterwards.

Here is a list of ones we recommend:  

* https://automatetheboringstuff.com/   
* https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ (the official tutorial)  
* http://www.diveintopython3.net/

Good luck!
