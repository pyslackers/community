# :tada: Welcome to the community! :tada:

We are glad that you have decided to join us.
There a few things that we have documented here to help you along from the beginning because we are grand believers in the Don't Repeat Yourself principle, and it just seems so professional!  

Dont forget to Introduce Yourself in the #introductions channel. Please provide your interests, hobbies, organization, or whatever. You can divulge as much as you want.  This is a good way to summon others of like interests. :wink:

Example:
```
Hello, everyone! My name is Ocat and I'm a full stack engineer @TacoBot My personal tech passions are working with APIs and giving out :taco:s. 
I like to give back to the open source community when I can. PS. I love asyncio. 
```

## Channels
If you are new to Slack then you should be aware of the concept of channels. Channels are a good way to keep conversations under the :umbrella: of a specific topic or context. Channels appear on the upper left side bar of the Slack UI.

Channel topics can be specific to the python packages you :heart: like #django, #flask, #sqlalchemy, etc. We also have channels that are for learning like #help and #learningpython. 

## Asking Questions
Remember these are just guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgement.

If the question relates to a channel topic then it is best to ask the question in that channel. When you have found the channel that best fits the topic of your question ask your question and wait for someone to respond. You do not need to say, `Hello` or `Is anyone in here that can help me?` Simply, ask your question and wait. Additionally, to receive the best help possible it is a good idea to have some code samples handy to post in the chat. The code samples section below will explain more about how to post them.

Asking good questions can be hard, generally it's best to say what you are trying to accomplish along with what you think you may need to do. For a good overview on how to ask good questions take a look at [How do I ask a good question?](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

## Cross posting
Please try to refrain from cross-posting in multiple channels. If you have asked your question in a channel and have waited a while you can move to a more #general channel. In order to cross-post, find your chat message and Share the message in the other channel.

## Code samples
Due to the nature of our wonderful and glorious community you may want to share code with us. Slack is really good for this. If your code sample is only a few lines you can use three backticks at the beginning of the code sample and after the sample. You may need to hit `SHIFT + ENTER` to create a new line.

If your code sample contains many lines then it is best to create a Snippet. You can do so from the chat box by clicking the plus sign. Snippets become files and can be commented on by other users.

## Self promotion and shameless plugs
To help prevent spam, and a wall of text in #general and other very active  channels, we have #shameless_plug to talk about your product, showcase it, ask for advice, or to ask people to try it out. These posts should only be in this channel and hence are not desired in other channels. We want to keep this a friendly place and we thought a channel dedicated to showcasing your work would work best.

## Taco Bot :taco:
When people in our community do good things we like to reward them with a :taco:! We are hoping that as B.F. Skinner used bird food with pigeons we can do the same with humans and tacos. This is positive reinforcement at its best (coders playing with psychology, what can go wrong?). 

If someone has done something worthy of a taco all you have to do is mention them and follow it with the taco emoji. 

## Community Driven Projects
Here are a couple of projects we have going on!

These community driven projects are hosted on GitHub. These projects are headed up by members of our community and are intended to provide value to our slack team and help members grow in their technical abilities. Each project has people who are leads and other members that act at a mentorship level. It's kinda like Xavier's school of gifted children except without a Blackbird SR-71.

Feel free to join the #community-projects channel and see where you can contribute, all contributions are welcomed from any skill level.  Low hanging fruit with getting started includes testing, documentation, code, feature ideas, bug reports, and front end design. You do not need to be a grandmaster python jedi in order to contribute to one of the projects. If you are we welcome that too :wink:.

### SIR BOT A LOT 
A slack bot written using asyncio. Asyncio is a new feature to Python 3. There isn't another bot out there like this one.

You can see what he can do with @sir-bot-a-lot help

### SLACK COMMUNITY WEBSITE

A website for this community written in Flask.

## Supporting the community

We are all here to build a community and serve each other. Here are some helpful ways you can support us!
Invite others
Be kind and respectful, even in disagreement
Ask and answer questions. We like people popping in when they need us, but we love people sticking around to chat and engage with other Pythonistas
Consider using our Digital Ocean referral code (https://m.do.co/c/457f0988c477) if you need a server. This will help cover costs for our #community-projects. Any "profits" received from this will be invested back into the community.

## Spam
We welcome people sharing what they are working on and asking for feedback, however - we have an expectation that you contribute to the community before asking for anything in return. Since we are an open community with a lot of members, we get spam from time-to-time. Usually this is clear by someone fresh to the community posting a self-promoting link that either requires payment or is survey immediately in #general.

Moderators will delete these types of posts and gently ask you to spend some time introducing yourself and contributing to the community :) 

## Need an admin?
We also have a channel named #admin-help in which you can make requests to admins such as new channels, nofitying of spammers or abusive users, or anything else you might need an admin for. You are also welcome to ask for a private PM from an admin if you would like to report something anonymously. There are multiple admins that cover a variety of time zones, so don't hesitate to message us.  If you would rather not message in that channel and would prefer to simply PM an admin, you can message @skift 

## Zen of Python
The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than right now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
    Lest you forget, import this

Did we miss anything?
If there is something that you wish you knew when you first started in this community you can add it. That's a good way to get a taco! Post in #introductions if you've added something, ok? cool. :+1:

Again, welcome to the community, and may your :taco:s be plentiful!
